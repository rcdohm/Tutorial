# Understanding number systems

<p>To start learning about binary, it would be good to understand the basis of numbers systems. <br> Everybody is familiar with the base 10 system of counting,
but what does base 10 actually mean?<br>When talking about number systems, each place in a number is represented by it's base, taken to the power of the place in the number. </p>

<p>For example, in base 10 the first position of any base 10 number is represented by 10<sup>0</sup>, which is 1. This is the "ones" place of a base 10 numbers and is used for single digit numbers
say for example, 5. As you are probably familiar with, once you reach the number 10, it can no longer be represented as a single digit. This is because
in a base 10 system, the next place of a base 10 number is 10<sup>1</sup>, which equals 10. This means that once you reach the number 10 it is represented by a 1 in the 
second place of the number. So 10 actually represents 1 grouping of 10, and 0 groupings of 1. This countinues as you keep counting, with 10<sup>2</sup> representing 
groupings of one hundred, and 10<sup>3</sup> representing groups of one thousand.</p>
